On February 18th, I installed this application on my iPhone 11, with iOS version 15.6, to control my bike's battery. On July 21, whee opening the application he gave a message that because it is very fast I can't write in full but essentially said that an error occurred and that some features could be unavailable.

The "Charging" and "Discharging" buttons were grayed and the battery could not be turned on. On the "Protection" page the MOS lock in parameter was red. I solved the problem with uninstalling/installing the application. On August 12, he made the same mistake again and resolved in the same way as the first time. I'm some fearful that one day I won't be able to solve this problem and run out of battery control. Can you help me? Thank You!
